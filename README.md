## About

Phantom is a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, semi-interactive image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like). It makes use of some SVG and animation techniques inspired by [Carrd](https://carrd.co) and includes a handy generic page for various uses.

Demo images are courtesy of **Unsplash**, a fantastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images you can use for almost anything.
